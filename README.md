# Invoice
A store sells two different types of monitors: Samsung ($190) and ViewSonic ($170). The store offers a 5% discount if ordering 3 or more monitors.

Write a C++ program that processes orders. Use constant declarations for all constant values. The program should process orders based on the userâ€™s input. Prompt the user to enter an order in the format: **(s or v) followed by the quantity**

The program should then ask the user if they live in Ohio. If the answer is yes, then a 7% tax should be added to the order.

Display the invoice details on the screen. You do not have to worry about checking for errors. Enter the data in lowercase letters. All dollar amounts must be shown with a dollar sign and two decimal places.
